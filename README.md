# norms-and-ellipses

Collection of scripts for studying generalised conics.
The Euclidean distance given by the usual norm  is replaced 
by a distance associated to a polygonal norm. 

An **ellipse**  is the set of points in the plane such that the sum of the
distances to the focii f1, f2 is a fixed number R > 0.

An **hyperbola**  is the set of points in the plane such that the difference of the
distances to the focii f1, f2 is a fixed number R.
